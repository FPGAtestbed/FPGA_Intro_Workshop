# Introduction to FPGA Programming Workshop

This repo contains materials for the Introduction to FPGA Programming Workshop. 

In the **docs** folder you'll find presentation slides that you may wish to refer back to, as well as information on connecting to the testbed and compiling your kernels. 

**HLS_examples** contains several sub-folders, each of which has a simple example kernel, and a markdown file containing some optimisation exercises. To do an exercise you'll need to go into the `vitis_hls` app and create a new project for each one. 

**sum_reduction_example** contains an example source file for you to convert into a FPGA compilation ready kernel, and compilation instructions for compiling it for emulation. 

**vitis_hls_example** contains some example source files which we'll use to walk you through the process of creating a Vitis HLS project, and analysing kernel performance.
